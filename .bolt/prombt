For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, modern, and production-ready using Ant Design (antd) components and design system.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Ant Design components, React hooks, and Ant Design's icon set. Do not install other UI libraries, icon packs, or theme packages unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use Ant Design icons for all iconography and follow Ant Design best practices for layout, theming, and responsiveness.
